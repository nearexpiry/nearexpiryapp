Describe the detailed techniques in your solution. For each part of the solution, put it in the context of the overall system or solution - where does it fit, what is its functionality? Do not just give a figure or an algorithm but explain in words what the design behind the method used is. If your method expands some prior method(s), refer to that, and point out the addition that you have done.

3.2.3 Legal Aspects 
   The legal aspects related to your designed solution. 
   
3.2.4 Design Constraints 
Any constraints/limitation on the design imposed on the solution by the legal aspects, standards, regulations, customers, development organization, limited resources, environmental concerns, performance constraints, social and ethical concerns, security, privacy, etc... 
   
3.2.5 Design Standards 
Any applicable standards that are followed towards the design of your solution and how the standards are acquired. Please refer and list the standards that are used in your design and how they are addressed in the different stages and in your design solution. 
A list of regional and international standards organizations is provided in the appendix section (A.2). 
   
   
3.2.6 Design Alternatives 
If there are alternate ways of your design solution, describe them and say why one is better than the others. 
   
3.2.7 Safety Consideration 
Safety in your designed solution. You can also address how to ensure the safety of your team members while implementing the project and the safety of your customers (end users) for your designed solution.

4.3 What are the trade-offs that you had to make in your design/implementation? 
4.4 What are the dependencies/assumptions of your implementation?






   

Chapter 5: Results and Discussion 
5.1 Present the results of your work and discuss them in detail and how they are linked to what has been discussed in the design chapter. 
5.2 Discuss the strengths and weaknesses of your solution/system.


   

Chapter 6: Economical, Ethic, and Contemporary Issues 
6.1 Preliminary Cost Estimation and Justification
6.2 Relevant Codes of Ethics and Moral Frameworks
6.3 Ethical Dilemmas and Justification of Proposed Solution
6.4 Relevant Environmental Considerations

A.1 Guidance on the use of the design consideration table*
Performance - How is the design to function? What need is it filling? What does it have to do? Is it reliable?
Serviceability - Is maintenance or repair a concern? If so, can it be easily performed?
Economic - Is the production and/or use costs considered?
Environmental - Does this have positive or negative impact to the environment? Are there any environmental effects due to the production, use or end-of-use of the design? Are appropriate materials selected?
Environmental Sustainability - (Sustainability refers to the practice of having minimal impact on the environment. Completely sustainable practices do not deplete or degrade the environment.) Does the design consider recycling, and using sustainable materials and manufacturing methods? Are renewable energy sources used (such as solar)? Does the product promote sustainable practices?
Manufacturability - Can the design be economically produced? Can critical elements be inspected?
Ethical - Has the student followed the code of ethics established by professional organizations such as ASME? Does the design benefit humanity? Have appropriate standards been applied? Are the design documents accurate with claims not overstated?
Health and safety - Have appropriate codes and standards been applied to prevent harm? Does the design mitigate harmful effects of failure to prevent injury? Does the design directly improve the health and safety of users?
Social - Does it benefit society? Are there societal implications of the product?
Political - Are there political implications of the project? What materials or parts would need to be imported? Would this be exported or imported?
